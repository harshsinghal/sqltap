Part of that reason was that it helped loading times a lot but not as much as it could have due to the collision mesh generation being excluded from it.\r\n\r\nWith the merging of #3099 giving us 3 very complex new space stations and very complex collision meshes I've tried to add support for serialising and deserialising the collision meshes into our SGM format.\r\n\r\n## Distribution:\r\nWith this change it would make sense to build the `.SGM` files in-place, delete the `.DAE` from the build and only have them in Git and `pioneer-assets`. \r\nThis way players don't have to worry about having the correct files or building `.SGM` versions.\r\n\r\n# Loading times:\r\nA quick comparison, please note that this is done on my laptop with a 512GiB SSD so there's little variation due to disk access, but possibly some due to thermal throttling/behaviour.\r\n\r\n## SGM Load times:\r\nI did 3 runs and the times were\r\n* Loading took: 23865.460385 milliseconds\r\n* Loading took: 23486.056590 milliseconds\r\n* Loading took: 23832.089322 milliseconds\r\nFor an average of **~23727.87** milliseconds.\r\n\r\n## Standard Load times:\r\nOnce again but with no SGM files.\r\n* Loading took: 128687.466982 milliseconds\r\n* Loading took: 126967.270705 milliseconds\r\n* Loading took: 126556.816863 milliseconds\r\nFor an average of **~127403.85** milliseconds\r\n\r\n## Result:\r\nThis means that using SGM files with the collision mesh data results in the game loading to the intro screen **~5.37** times faster.\r\n\r\n# At the Command line:\r\n**WARNING**: The SGM files this creates will be chosen in preference to the original data in future so you might miss updates to files. Best to delete all of these SGM files after experimenting with this **WARNING**\r\n\r\nTo recreate the SGM files you just need to build the ModelCompiler, this should be shipped with the binaries versions, or you can build it yourself. It's built alongside Pioneer.\r\nSimply go to the Pioneer folder where ModelCompiler & Pioneer reside, open a prompt / terminal and enter something like: `modelcompiler -b inplace`\r\nThat will create an SGM file for every model in the game and place it next to it's `.model` file.\r\n\r\n# Status:\r\nWorth testing, as I've just fixed the bug I had caused and collision now works again. Loads fast and works!\r\n\r\nI've chosen to **compress** all of the SGM files the modelcompilier produces as this results in a reduction from ~132MB down to just ~39.5MB which is a significant reduction. It does have a negative impact on the loading times, raising it from an average 20 seconds to 24 seconds. However I think this is more than worth it.\r\n\r\nAndy"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pioneerspacesim/pioneer/issues/comments/68489852","html_url":"https://github.com/pioneerspacesim/pioneer/pull/3297#issuecomment-68489852","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/pioneerspacesim/pioneer/issues/3297","id":68489852,"user":{"login":"fluffyfreak","id":825083,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/825083?v=3","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/fluffyfreak","html_url":"https://github.com/fluffyfreak","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fluffyfreak/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fluffyfreak/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fluffyfreak/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fluffyfreak/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fluffyfreak/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fluffyfreak/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fluffyfreak/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fluffyfreak/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/fluffyfreak/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-01-01T15:48:20Z","updated_at":"2015-01-01T15:48:20Z","body":"Tested with Linux/Windows with and without sgm files, it's no worse without and them and much better with them so have merged."}},"public":true,"created_at":"2015-01-01T15:48:20Z","org":{"id":719820,"login":"pioneerspacesim","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/pioneerspacesim","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/719820?"}}

It seems quite stable, been using it for a few days (provided the configuration is correct, I suppose, didn't test what happens when ghc-modi is not correctly configured).\r\n\r\nI bound the type info call to the DocumentationProvider as well as to an action (alt - equals, like scala). I prefer the action, I think the documentation provider doesn't work so well. There are tests of the parsing of the output of ghc-modi, but not really of the documentationprovider, basically because of the abundance of static calls and the fact that I think they can only be mocked while testing, and statics can only be mocked through Powermock if I recall correctly, which would mean an extra test dependency and so on and so forth, so I left that to be your call.\r\n\r\nAlso, there is a weird behaviour that getting the editor creates a stack trace of around 5 kilometers long, something that seems like a threading issue, but the function seems to work. I don't really know why the stack trace happens, all the more because it only happens when calling the type information through the documentation provider (same code path is used when the action is called, but no stack trace). Maybe you know more what could go wrong, it looks like something intellij-related.\r\n\r\nSo, consider this a \"request for comment\" more than a pull request ;-)\r\n\r\nKasper"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/carymrobbins/intellij-haskforce/issues/comments/68489090","html_url":"https://github.com/carymrobbins/intellij-haskforce/pull/105#issuecomment-68489090","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/carymrobbins/intellij-haskforce/issues/105","id":68489090,"user":{"login":"KasperJanssens","id":5415995,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5415995?v=3","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/KasperJanssens","html_url":"https://github.com/KasperJanssens","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KasperJanssens/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KasperJanssens/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KasperJanssens/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KasperJanssens/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KasperJanssens/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KasperJanssens/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KasperJanssens/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KasperJanssens/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/KasperJanssens/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-01-01T15:27:48Z","updated_at":"2015-01-01T15:27:48Z","body":"Concerning the tests, I think I could a little better but I'm afraid that to test some things like those static calls to GhcMod(i) I need to depend on a mocking framework like mockito or powermock, don't know what you think about that. I also didn't realize the tests were JUnit 3, any reason for that, is that enforced by the intellij plugin stuff or so? I don't know whether it would be a problem for the newer mockito or powermock versions. Anyway, something to consider in case we would like to extend the tests with mocks.\r\nConcerning the refactor, I just looked at my freshly added stuff, didn't check whether there was a need to refactor some of the older stuff.

If the value being filtered exists in the list of known values, the filter will return the value if its a whitelist or `null` if its a blacklist. The opposite will happen if value is not in the list.\r\n\r\n### Whitelist\r\n```php\r\n$whitelist = new \\Zend\\Filter\\Whitelist(array(\r\n    'list' => array('allowed-1', 'allowed-2')\r\n));\r\necho $whitelist->filter('allowed-2');   // => 'allowed-2'\r\necho $whitelist->filter('not-allowed'); // => null\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Blacklist\r\n```php\r\n$blacklist = new \\Zend\\Filter\\Whitelist(array(\r\n    'type' => 'blacklist', // optional, default is 'whitelist'\r\n    'list' => array('not-allowed-1', 'not-allowed-2')\r\n));\r\necho $blacklist->filter('allowed');        // => 'allowed'\r\necho $blacklist->filter('not-allowed-2');  // => null\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Notes  \r\n\r\n1. Maybe calling the filter class `Whitelist` might be counter-intuitive if the desired behavior is that of a blacklist. But I couldn't think of a better way to name the filter, so I'm open to suggestions:\r\n    * Something like \"AllowedList\" would just be a synonym of \"whitelist\". \r\n    * \"List\" would just be too vague.\r\n    * Separate filter classes seemed overkill.\r\n2. I decided to allow only one type of configuration in the constructor (by array of options) just to keep it simple. If you'd like to allow for a more dynamic constructor (like a few other filters do) let me know.\r\n3. Not sure what commit edbc12b is doing in this PR. Looks like its in `master` but not in `develop`.\r\n\r\nSee #6960 for more

I think it's really close!\r\n\r\n## Nav\r\n\r\n- Top navigation now links to `Participate` which is information about the call, and `Apply` which is the actual form. Bootstrap has a cool little highlighted label where I put the date, but we could also do a countdown.\r\n\r\n![screen shot 2014-12-31 at 8 08 41 pm](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/462020/5591426/d739785e-9128-11e4-9c03-d373322ce58f.png)\r\n\r\n## Participate\r\n\r\n1.

Migrating from Google Forms (off-site form, spreadsheet backend, free) to Formkeep (on-site form, very usable backend, pay what you wish).\r\n  - With Google Forms we didn't have much control over how the application looked, and answers were stored in a hard to read spreadsheet.\r\n  - Formkeep is simply an endpoint that accepts answers from a form on our site, displays the answers in a much more readable backend, and allows us to search applications and mark spam if necessary.\r\n2. Application is editable via `/_data/application.json`, and is completely customizable.\r\n3. Sidebar shows application/admissions timeline and helpful hints.\r\n\r\n![apply school for poetic computation 20141231](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/462020/5591350/809b6d3a-9124-11e4-94a8-46257ddf3a36.png)\r\n\r\n## Thanks\r\n\r\n1.

It appears that the default instance implementation of toJSON detects and automatically serializes any eagerly loaded associations on the model. However, the name that the associations are loaded under is the capitalized and pluralized name of the association. So if I have a 'Topic' model with a 'Category' association such that `Topic.belongsTo(Category)`, if I eagerly load the category with the topic, I get `topic.Category`. Obviously this is a trivial example but I'm wondering if there is some way to access a list of eagerly loaded associations from within the toJSON() instance method so that I can programmatically rename and serialize all of the eagerly loaded associations?"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sequelize/sequelize/issues/comments/68490000","html_url":"https://github.com/sequelize/sequelize/issues/2493#issuecomment-68490000","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/sequelize/sequelize/issues/2493","id":68490000,"user":{"login":"mickhansen","id":699049,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/699049?v=3","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/mickhansen","html_url":"https://github.com/mickhansen","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mickhansen/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mickhansen/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mickhansen/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mickhansen/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mickhansen/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mickhansen/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mickhansen/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mickhansen/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/mickhansen/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-01-01T15:55:29Z","updated_at":"2015-01-01T15:55:29Z","body":"@memelet depends on what you want to do"}},"public":true,"created_at":"2015-01-01T15:55:29Z","org":{"id":3591786,"login":"sequelize","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/sequelize","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3591786?"}}

Part of that reason was that it helped loading times a lot but not as much as it could have due to the collision mesh generation being excluded from it.\r\n\r\nWith the merging of #3099 giving us 3 very complex new space stations and very complex collision meshes I've tried to add support for serialising and deserialising the collision meshes into our SGM format.\r\n\r\n## Distribution:\r\nWith this change it would make sense to build the `.SGM` files in-place, delete the `.DAE` from the build and only have them in Git and `pioneer-assets`. \r\nThis way players don't have to worry about having the correct files or building `.SGM` versions.\r\n\r\n# Loading times:\r\nA quick comparison, please note that this is done on my laptop with a 512GiB SSD so there's little variation due to disk access, but possibly some due to thermal throttling/behaviour.\r\n\r\n## SGM Load times:\r\nI did 3 runs and the times were\r\n* Loading took: 23865.460385 milliseconds\r\n* Loading took: 23486.056590 milliseconds\r\n* Loading took: 23832.089322 milliseconds\r\nFor an average of **~23727.87** milliseconds.\r\n\r\n## Standard Load times:\r\nOnce again but with no SGM files.\r\n* Loading took: 128687.466982 milliseconds\r\n* Loading took: 126967.270705 milliseconds\r\n* Loading took: 126556.816863 milliseconds\r\nFor an average of **~127403.85** milliseconds\r\n\r\n## Result:\r\nThis means that using SGM files with the collision mesh data results in the game loading to the intro screen **~5.37** times faster.\r\n\r\n# At the Command line:\r\n**WARNING**: The SGM files this creates will be chosen in preference to the original data in future so you might miss updates to files. Best to delete all of these SGM files after experimenting with this **WARNING**\r\n\r\nTo recreate the SGM files you just need to build the ModelCompiler, this should be shipped with the binaries versions, or you can build it yourself. It's built alongside Pioneer.\r\nSimply go to the Pioneer folder where ModelCompiler & Pioneer reside, open a prompt / terminal and enter something like: `modelcompiler -b inplace`\r\nThat will create an SGM file for every model in the game and place it next to it's `.model` file.\r\n\r\n# Status:\r\nWorth testing, as I've just fixed the bug I had caused and collision now works again. Loads fast and works!\r\n\r\nI've chosen to **compress** all of the SGM files the modelcompilier produces as this results in a reduction from ~132MB down to just ~39.5MB which is a significant reduction. It does have a negative impact on the loading times, raising it from an average 20 seconds to 24 seconds.

Feel free to propose any other solution for this, but I noticed myself that it is pretty annoying having to click `CANCEL` every single time.."},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SecUpwN/Android-IMSI-Catcher-Detector/issues/comments/68488895","html_url":"https://github.com/SecUpwN/Android-IMSI-Catcher-Detector/issues/251#issuecomment-68488895","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/SecUpwN/Android-IMSI-Catcher-Detector/issues/251","id":68488895,"user":{"login":"SecUpwN","id":6000299,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6000299?v=3","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/SecUpwN","html_url":"https://github.com/SecUpwN","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SecUpwN/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SecUpwN/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SecUpwN/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SecUpwN/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SecUpwN/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SecUpwN/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SecUpwN/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SecUpwN/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/SecUpwN/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-01-01T15:18:52Z","updated_at":"2015-01-01T15:18:52Z","body":"@E3V3A, which second message?

For example:\r\n```<html xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\" xmlns:og=\"http://ogp.me/ns#\">```\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\nRendering tag in a layout:\r\n```php\r\necho $this->html()->openTag(); \r\n//...\r\necho $this->html()->closeTag();\r\n```\r\n\r\nAdding attributes:\r\n```php\r\n//single\r\n$this->html()->setAttribute('xmlns', 'http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml');\r\n\r\n//multiple\r\n$this->html()->setAttributes(array(\r\n    'xmlns' => 'http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml',\r\n    'prefix' => 'og:

Now you are allowed to move the character where you used the item once(or as often as you used the item) in the char select. So go back into char select menu.
